# Example Four

This example shows basic function declaration and using a `while (condition)` loop to get appropriate user input. This is not best practice for handling errors, but is meant to illustrate a point of looping back to the start of a code block instead of exiting the program. 

1. Define a variable that takes two numbers and return the largest of the two numbers.
2. Declare your input variables and create a boolean with the value of `true` for use in your while loop.
3. inside of a while loop, prompt for inputs for your variables. 
4. If the two variables are equal, explain the problem and loop back to the beginning of the code block to reexecute.
5. If a Max can be found, using `std::cout` print the Max number and set your boolean value to false.

Alternate methods include using a Try/Catch statement. You can read more about these [here](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/try_catch), though these will be covered later.
