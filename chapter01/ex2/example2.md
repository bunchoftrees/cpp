# Example Two

This example starts to break down some of the structure of a simple program, and gets into the use of Macros that use the `#define` keyword. 
1. Add `#include` for both standard io and string handling
2. `#define` macros to use later (These are kind of like global variables in other languages). [This](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30000871/what-is-the-difference-between-global-variables-and-define-in-c) is a really good **Stack Overflow** post about the difference and nuances with both.
3. In `main()` create a variable and store user input.
4. Add logic using a if/else statement [This](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_conditions.asp) tutorial on **W3Schools** explains a bit more on when and why we should use `else if` vs `else`.
5. Build and test your program with different inputs. 
6. Modify your program to handle different inputs for more practice.
